Hello, my name is Alvin. Three words I believe describe me well are
indecisive, open-minded, and humble.

One hobby I enjoy is going searching for the latest scientific
advancements. I tend to spend alot of my free time trying to keep
up to date with it all. Physics and biology(specifically biomedical
engineering) are my 2 favorites. But chemistry and math are not far 
behind. I tend to overwhel myself and ask questions that are out of 
the scope of things because i wonder how everything factors in together
on a grand scale. It will be a good quality once I obtain the correct
amount of knowledge of many fields. But there are still many holes 
that need to be filled.
