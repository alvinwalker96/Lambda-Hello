Hello, my name is Alvin. Three words I believe describe me well are
agressive, close-minded, and cocky.

One hobby I enjoy is watching paint dry. I love to just sit down, stare at a freshly painted wall, and just lose myself.
The aromas at time become unbareable. Sometimes I can't control my urge to stick my tounge out and give the wall a good licking.
I don't care the color or size of the room. As long as the paint is wet to the touch, IT'S ON!!!
